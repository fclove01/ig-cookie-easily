# Privacy Policy for IG Cookie Manager

**Last Updated:** April 4, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how the "IG Cookie Manager" Chrome Extension ("the Extension") handles your information.

**1. Data Handling:**

* The Extension reads, writes, and deletes cookies specifically for the `instagram.com` domain directly within your browser using the standard `chrome.cookies` API provided by Google Chrome.
* **No Data Collection:** The Extension **does not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data, Browse history, or cookie information with the developer or any third-party servers.
* **Local Operation:** All operations performed by the Extension occur locally on your computer within your Chrome browser environment. Cookie data read by the Extension is displayed to you in the text area or used to set cookies back into the browser upon your explicit action (clicking the "LOG In" button). It is not persisted by the Extension itself after the popup is closed, except for what remains in the text area until manually cleared or overwritten.

**2. Permissions:**

The Extension requires the following permissions, solely for its core functionality:
* `cookies`: To read, write, and delete cookies for `instagram.com`.
* `tabs`: To open a new tab to `instagram.com` after successfully setting cookies.
* `host_permissions` for `*://*.instagram.com/`: To grant access to cookies specifically on the Instagram domain.

**3. User Responsibility:**

* You are responsible for the security and handling of any cookie strings you copy, paste, or manage using this Extension. Do not share your cookies.

**4. Changes to This Policy:**

* We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension's description or repository.

**5. Contact Us:**
